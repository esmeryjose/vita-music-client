> Event gathering application that allows attendees to contribute to an event by adding songs to a common playlist.


The whole idea behind this web app was to make it easier to handle the music at gatherings. One thing I have experienced in the past is that everyone wants their favorite songs to get played at some point. In many cases we see people passing around the AUX cord to play songs from their phones. Using my product we can solve this problem by having users sign in with their spotify accounts, rsvp to the event and then add songs to the playlist of that event.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```
or 
```sh
yarn 
```

## Usage example

Lets Assume for second its your birthday and you want to have your friends over. With my product you can create an event and have your friends rsvp and start adding songs to the playlist. To add a song a user must first search for it, in which case this application will respond with a collection of songs that match the search criteria. The user can now listen to the song and see if thats the one they were looking for.
